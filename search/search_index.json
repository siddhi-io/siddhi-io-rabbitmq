The value must be either 1 or 2 .If the delivery.mode = 1, then the connection is not persistent. If the delivery.mode = 2, then the connection is persistent. 1 INT Yes No content.type The message content type. This should be the MIME content type. null STRING Yes No content.encoding The message content encoding. The value should be MIME content encoding. null STRING Yes No priority Specify a value within the range 0 to 9 in this parameter to indicate the message priority. 0 INT Yes Yes correlation.id The message correlated to the current message. e.g., The request to which this message is a reply. When a request arrives, a message describing the task is pushed to the queue by the front end server. After that the frontend server blocks to wait for a response message with the same correlation ID. A pool of worker machines listen on queue, and one of them picks up the task, performs it, and returns the result as message. Once a message with right correlation ID arrives, thefront end server continues to return the response to the caller. null STRING Yes Yes reply.to This is an anonymous exclusive callback queue. When the RabbitMQ receives a message with the reply.to property, it sends the response to the mentioned queue. This is commonly used to name a reply queue (or any other identifier that helps a consumer application to direct its response). null STRING Yes No expiration The expiration time after which the message is deleted. The value of the expiration field describes the TTL (Time To Live) period in milliseconds. null STRING Yes No message.id The message identifier. If applications need to identify messages, it is recommended that they use this attribute instead of putting it into the message payload. null STRING Yes Yes timestamp Timestamp of the moment when the message was sent. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, the system automatically generates the current date and time as the timestamp value. The format of the timestamp value is dd/mm/yyyy . current timestamp STRING Yes No type The type of the message. e.g., The type of the event or the command represented by the message. null STRING Yes No user.id The user ID specified here is verified by RabbitMQ against theuser name of the actual connection. This is an optional parameter. null STRING Yes No app.id The identifier of the application that produced the message. null STRING Yes No routing.key The key based on which the excahnge determines how to route the message to the queue. The routing key is similar to an address for the message. empty STRING Yes Yes headers The headers of the message. The attributes used for routing are taken from the this paremeter. A message is considered matching if the value of the header equals the value specified upon binding. null STRING Yes Yes tls.enabled This parameter specifies whether an encrypted communication channel should be established or not. When this parameter is set to true , the tls.truststore.path and tls.truststore.password parameters are initialized. false BOOL Yes No tls.truststore.path The file path to the location of the truststore of the client that sends the RabbitMQ events via the AMQP protocol. A custom client-truststore can be specified if required. If a custom truststore is not specified, then the system uses the default client-trustore in the ${carbon.home}/resources/security directory. ${carbon.home}/resources/security/client-truststore.jks STRING Yes No tls.truststore.password The password for the client-truststore. A custom password can be specified if required.
